   Create a p&l measure based off trial balance dependent on time period selected 
  ( Create P&L monthly, quarterly annually and PY measures)

 - Display P&L at different granularities
    - For example only allow cost of sales to drill to account level 2, expenses to account level 3

  - Ensure I can get a P&L that can do MTD, QTD, YTD all in one pivot table

  - Create BS measure
  
  - In respect of the missing lookups measure and missing lookup checks --> return OK if data load is set to false, irrespective of whether there is a lookup missing


  - Create a readme

- Don't forget to use DAX studio for debugging, performance measurement and measure creation
