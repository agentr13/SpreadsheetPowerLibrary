  - Move DAX query across from SpreadsheetBI (may have to check older versions github) that checks for items in datatables not in lookup tables
   --> This is in the DaxMeasureLibraryFolder of spreadsheetBI in text format.
   --> Maybe create as an actual Meausure rather than just example text
   --> Write Meausres etc to table with already created Spreadsheet BI functionality--> this can then also be saved as Spreadsheetmetadata
 
 - Create a readme

- Don't forget to use DAX studio for debugging, performance measurement and measure creation

 - Read in sample financial data
    * Do I want to do this in spreadsheetBI?
    * Maybe move all power query and 
    * Need to make path relative.

- Create a trial balance measure 

 - Create measure check to ensure that TB = sum of journals
 
  Create a p&l measure based off trial balance dependent on time period selected 
  ( Create P&L monthly, quarterly annually and PY measures)
  
  - Create BS measure
  
  - In respect of the missing lookups measure and missing lookup checks --> return OK if data load is set to false, irrespective of whether there is a lookup missing
