OkToDisplayPandL measure --> Only allow display when either whole month is selected or last day of the month is selected

Conditional formatting for YTD and MTD in pivot table?


For YTD and QTD P&L it is possible that entire year has been selected.  When the TB is picked up to calculate the P&L pick up the tb at the max value.

Reference a Tb and jnl measure in the p and l measure rather than tables directly in the event Tb and jnl measures could be more complicated with multiple hierarchies etc

Continue to build out OkToDisplayP&L, OkToDisplayP&LYTD, OkToDisplayP&LQTD, OkToDisplayP&LMTD

Use measure RestrictHierachyLevels to modify P&L display

Allow different filtering for Jnl level P&L vs Account level P&L

   Create a p&l measure based off trial balance dependent on time period selected 
  ( Create P&L monthly, quarterly annually and PY measures)

 - Only display for example YTD P&L if month is the last month with data in year, for example dont display Aug YTD if Sep YTD exists
    allow above behaviour to be turned on with flag
    also have flags for only display YTD for full year


 - Display P&L at different granularities
    - For example only allow cost of sales to drill to account level 2, expenses to account level 3

  - Ensure I can get a P&L that can do MTD, QTD, YTD all in one pivot table

  - Create BS measure
  
  - In respect of the missing lookups measure and missing lookup checks --> return OK if data load is set to false, irrespective of whether there is a lookup missing


  - Create a readme

- Don't forget to use DAX studio for debugging, performance measurement and measure creation
   Dax studio F6 for format or Ctrl F6 for short form formatting
