Continue to work on Measures_PandL.  (Look at measures_Journal for time calculation guidance guidance)

Create an example of day level data

Don't bundle the OKToDisplayRawData measure into above.  Rather test for them seperately in the transactions measure

Next work on OkToDisplayData (in Measures_DataCalculations) which references the above and adds items depending on DataTypeSelected

Can I generalise the p&l measures to be broader than just p&l.  In essence these are simply difference between dates and point in time measures.  They could also be used for  tbs of different sorts etc.   There are really 3 WWITcalculation methods
- point in time
- movement between points in time
- sum of transactions

Get rid of FinancialDataGranularity and MeasuresPandL if the generalisation works


Temporarily go back to Spreadsheet BI and look at how measures are saved.  There is an issue with the pipe delimted output and line feeds.
Also worthwhile getting the table name into the HumanReadable dax measures


Conditional formatting for YTD and MTD in pivot table? --> Yes this is possible

Use measure RestrictHierachyLevels to modify P&L display

Allow different filtering for Jnl level P&L vs Account level P&L

   Create a p&l measure based off trial balance dependent on time period selected 
  ( Create P&L monthly, quarterly annually and PY measures)

 - Display P&L at different granularities
    - For example only allow cost of sales to drill to account level 2, expenses to account level 3

   - Create BS measure
  
  - In respect of the missing lookups measure and missing lookup checks --> return OK if data load is set to false, irrespective of whether there is a lookup missing


  - Create a readme

- Don't forget to use DAX studio for debugging, performance measurement and measure creation
   Dax studio F6 for format or Ctrl F6 for short form formatting
